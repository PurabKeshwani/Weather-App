# 🌤️ Weather App

A sleek, minimalistic weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon based on the current conditions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Get instant weather updates for any city.
- **Dynamic Icons**: Icons change based on current weather conditions like rain, clouds, clear skies, and more.
- **Search Functionality**: Simple and efficient search bar to look up weather by city name.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid city names trigger a friendly error message.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with glassmorphism aesthetics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the app.
- **CSS3**: For styling the interface with a modern glassmorphism design.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and displaying weather data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides the weather data for any location.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

The app's interface uses a stylish, modern glassmorphism theme for a light and elegant feel. The background image dynamically enhances the user experience by blending with the app’s glass-like elements.
